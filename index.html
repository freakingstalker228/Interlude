<h1 align="center"> Interlude </h1>

    <p class="arial">
         <p>Quiet, rhythmical sound of steps asphalt, from time to time interrupted by frequent, abrupt beats – stones breaking off 
         <br>walls and roofs, hitting the road. Historical district of the city, it started falling apart first. He decided to try his
         <br>luck here – who knows if he’ll find something interesting? Remains of past life, hints of stories and secrets - answer to 
         <br>which is revealed by looking from a correct angle – he likes it all.</p> 

         <p>He stops before one building. Soft peach colour of the walls is still recognizable, even though the paint has many cracks
         <br>and fell off almost entirely in a couple of places. A peach tree on the right, its branches reaching inside the room on
         <br>the second floor through the broken windows. He makes a few steps down the road. The left side of the house is covered by
         <br>lianes of – he looks attentively – grapes? That would mean he’s pretty far from home already. He closes his eyes and tries
         <br>to imagine how the house looked before… welcoming and nice, must have been owned by a sweet family. He walks up to a door
         <br>and opens it, pressing the handle lightly. If he’s right, then this house definitely has some stories he’d want to hear.</p>

         <p>Creaking, the door opens, showing him yet another familiar scene: all furniture in place, covered with piles of dust – as
         <br>if the owners have suddenly left, but didn’t take anything with them. People treasure their posessions so much – it is their
         <br>memory and the reward for their hard work. The only sensible reason for them to leave everything behind would be a threat
         <br>of radiation. He hums. What if that’s it? Everyone’s forgotten him in hastle of evacuation. After all, he’s always been almost 
         <br>like a ghost…</p>

         <p>He shakes his head, snapping out of the rumination. He didn’t come here just to sink in these thoughts again. 
           <br>Yet, looks like it was fated for him on that day…</p>

         <p>Something caught his eye. A bit torn, with mark of some animals claws – probably, that’s how it ended up in the middle of
         <br>the room – a ball for volleyball. Exactly the same as the one he used to play with. His eyes remain fixed on it for a few
         <br>minutes, and at last – he sits down against a wall, giving in. Tired of fighting his mind, he lets the memories flow into it. 
         <br>Volleyball practice, friends from there. His youth. All the pain of it. Things that brought him happiness.. his flowers… 
         <br>his collection.. his sister and his friends. Thoughts are flowing calmly, one after another, stirring up all kinds of feelings
         <br>in his chest, gradually coming up to what he mulled over so many times in his solitude…</p>
 
         <p>From the very first day, when he was trying to find at least someone in horrible panic, when he thought it’s just another bad 
         <br>dream of his, when he realized they’re all gone, among countless scenarios and options for an explanation – there was one he’d
         <br>like to believe. What if it’s him who’d died and forgotten his death, and angels were naugh but a flash of light before the car
         <br>hit him, and all happening now is a long, long, stretched out into eternity dream he’s having, while broken ribs tear his skin, 
         <br>blood sreams down the road in a vicious spring, along with tears leak out his eyes, and children on the playground nearby freeze 
         <br>in fear, seeing the crooked, wrong figure he’s now become..  He hopes that it’s so, for it means all dear to his heart are safe 
         <br>and sound.</p>

         <p>What if truly – all he’s seen since that day, all that he knows for sure must be true, for he feels it in every plant, in every
         <br>animal, every step he makes on the barren land – has a different cause? It’s not the world that’s slowly losing colours, not the
         <br>gaps in time and space in form of dreadful dark void appearing here and there, not the light of Moon and Sun gone from the sky
         <br>along with the Heavenly realm. It’s his body slowly losing warmth, his thoughts slowing down and dreams fading away, gaps in 
         <br>memory taking away greater and greater moments of his life. What if motives brought by the Seven Angels are to his 
         <br>ears – are about him only?</p>

         <p>And once again, his mind returned to the first and last day of the New World. No matter how much time passed, 
         <br>he’s always remembered it in the clearest detail.</p> 

         <p>The clouds made way for a ray of white light from the skies. First one thin beam, it consumed the entire world in what could
         <br>have been both a moment and an eternity. Being drowned in this white light was the last thing he saw, the last moment of the 
         <br>Old World. Apocalypse, brought upon by Seven Angels in their divine song. Fate of this world had been pre-written, all – by 
         <br>God’s wish that they tried to understand, yet failed. Motives of God cannot be comprehended by a human mind.</p> 

         <p>He doesn’t know their motives either. Eventually, he’s understood that there are no answers to the questions he asked in the
         <br>New World. There isn’t anything at all, except for hints of past lives, containing little bits of colour in them. Yet, as soon
         <br>as he’d figure out a riddle – the colors would fade away, at last being in peace. Maybe that’s why he stayed behind everyone 
         <br>else – to be the reaper for the traces of kindness, love, laughter, joy and care left behind by those he at times believed to
         <br>be incapable of it? It’s a lonely duty that he’s put onto himself… but with desolation, he’s found freedom. That very freedom 
         <br>helped him to accept the loss of everyone he loved, everything he’d been used to, the past life… he missed it a little, but he’d
         <br>never missed the past world. This new one, quiet and clear, was fading away slowly and painlessly. Along with the sky, fields
         <br>and trees has changed even the air. Without any more suffering, it was clean and tasted like fresh spring water, filling his
         <br>lungs with every breath. Winds have always blown in a right direction for him, always gently, never too cold or hot. They were
         <br>lifting up his well-worn clothes and his wavy long hair, letting it flutter slightly, as if showing him his grace. Pondering on 
         <br>why did the Wind become so humane, he remembered how it occasionally leads him out to objects with memories, still in colours –
         <br>and figured: wind picks up the remains of life all over the world.</p> 
 
         <p>One thing about those memories was that there’s never been any pain among them, as if it has been purged – that’s why he’s called
         <br>it “The Cleansing”. <i>No rage, no despair, no grief and doubts… this world already knew the date of its death.</i> Everything 
         <br>that he saw, no matter how he would look – seemed to have already made peace with it. Animals did not run nor fight anymore. 
         <br>Why bother if the time of end is set?</p>

         <p>It was different for him though. He became as if invisible for Death, never feeling it’s presence anymore. For him, Death no 
         <br>longer existed… or at least, wasn’t a threat. With such peace and acceptance surrounding him, the necessity of his doubts
         <br>became frail. And soon, he let go of them. By making peace with the world, he has made peace with the world around.</p>

         <p>Yet, in this endless solitude, there was a break to his loneliness. Ravens, a symbol of Death – were now everywhere, taking
         <br>notice of Old World’s passing. Once, too consumed by his thoughts, he didn’t notice right under his step – it was their 
         <br>croacking that awakened him in time. He’s noticed – there is especially many of them around Voids. Maybe, they are nothing
         <br>but embodiment of Death itself. He even tried to ask. Yet, aside from the stare of two empty, as if artificial eyes, no
         <br>response followed. Maybe, he really is the only one left in this New World. Here, his reality is free of pain and calamities,
         <br>but – is freedom gifted by such a loss a curse or a blessing?</p>

         <p>He sighs, raising up on the numb legs. How much time has passed? No telling by the unchanging gray sky. He opens the door – 
         <br><i>and the whole world is facing him when he looks outside.</i></p>
